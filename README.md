# Prime Numbers Summation in Java

This Java program reads an array of numbers, identifies prime numbers, and calculates their sum. It optimizes prime checking using the square root method for better efficiency. The program ensures proper input handling and prints the prime numbers found.

## üíª Uses
- Helps in understanding **prime numbers** and their properties.
- Demonstrates **efficient prime number checking** using the square root method.
- Provides a **real-world example** of working with arrays and loops in Java.
- Useful for **number theory problems** and **competitive programming**.

## üî¢ What is a Prime Number?
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than **1** that has only **two factors**: **1 and itself**.

**Examples of Prime Numbers:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...

**Non-Prime Numbers (Composite Numbers):**
- 4 (Factors: 1, 2, 4)
- 6 (Factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
- 9 (Factors: 1, 3, 9)

### Special Cases:
- **1 is NOT a prime number** (it has only one factor: 1 itself).
- **2 is the only even prime number** (since all other even numbers are divisible by 2).

## ‚ö° How This Program Works
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Handling**
- The user is prompted to **enter the size** of the array.
- The user then inputs **elements** into the array.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Prime Numbers**
- Each number in the array is checked using the `isPrime()` method.
- If a number is **prime**, it is added to the `sum`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Displaying Output**
- The program prints **all prime numbers found** in the array.
- It displays the **sum of all prime numbers**.

## üîç Understanding the `isPrime()` Method
The `isPrime()` method determines whether a given number is **prime or not**.

### **Prime Checking Algorithm According to Your Code**
1. **Initialize `count = 0`**, which keeps track of the number of factors.  
2. **Loop from `1` to `n`** and check if `n` is divisible by `i`.  
3. **Increase `count`** whenever `n % i == 0`.  
4. **If `count == 2`**, return `true` (the number has only two factors: 1 and itself, meaning it's prime).  
5. **Otherwise, return `false`** (the number has more than two factors, meaning it's not prime).

## üìú Full Java Code
```java
package primeNum_and_Summations;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfPrimeNums 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the Size of Array");
		int size = s.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[size];
		System.out.println("Enter the Elements");
		for(int i=0;i<=arr.length-1;i++)
		{
			arr[i] = s.nextInt();
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i=0;i<=arr.length-1;i++)
		{
			if(isPrime(arr[i]))
			{
				sum += arr[i];
				System.out.print(arr[i] + ",");
			}
		}
		System.out.println("Sum Of Prime Numbers " + sum);
	}
	public static boolean isPrime(int n)
	{
		int count = 0;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		{
			if(n%i==0)
				count++;
		}
		if(count==2)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}
}
